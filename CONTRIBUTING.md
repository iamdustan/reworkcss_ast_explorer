## Thank you for contributing

Please note that this project is a fork of @fkling’s [Esprima AST Explorer](https://github.com/fkling/esprima_ast_explorer)**

The only changes at this point are swapping out Esprima-fb and escodegen for
Rework’s css parser and stringifier and upgrading React. It is likely that your
request should be filed at the upstream project. Please consider and file there
if it is more appropriate.

Beyond that, follow house rules. Style and build system should mirror the
upstream branch as closely as possible.
